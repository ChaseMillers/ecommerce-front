## Summary
This e-commerce website was created to be a starting point template for my clients. It has all the basic features you would expect from an e-commerce website and more, such as letting the admin add/delete, track, and change products from their website dashboard. It includes a purchase summary email for the user and admin after every purchase. I created and photoshopped together some products for the website. The products are not real.
