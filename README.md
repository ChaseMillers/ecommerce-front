## Summery 
This e-commerce website was designed as a template for anyone that wants to sell products. 
It was made to have all the basic features you would expect from an e-commerce website as well as features that let the admin add/delete and change products for the shopping page. It includes a purchase summary page for user and admin. The front end is deployed from Zeit and backend with Heroku.  

Software used:
<br/>React
<br/>MongoDB 
<br/>Node.js
<br/>Braintree â€“ for implementing paypal and credit information
<br/>Heroku
<br/>Zeit
